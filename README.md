There were 3 objectives in this problem statement. 1st objective was related to using over 300 social determinant varibles to predict health risk score due to various social risks like transportation, education, pollution, technology etc. 2nd objective needed us to provide reccomendations based on the risk score. And the 3rd objective was translating this whole thing to the Indian context, as the dataset was based on American lifestyle and social situation
